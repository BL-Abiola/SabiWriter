## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant orange (#FF7F50) to capture the energetic and lively spirit of Nigerian business culture. Orange is often associated with enthusiasm, creativity, and success, making it ideal for attracting attention and conveying a sense of dynamism.
- Background color: Light, desaturated orange (#FFEBCD) to provide a warm, inviting base. This soft hue, also known as bisque, creates a soothing and welcoming atmosphere, suggesting approachability and comfort.
- Accent color: A slightly reddish-orange (#FA8072) to highlight key call-to-action elements and important information. Salmon-like tones create a sense of urgency, excitement and enthusiasm, encouraging users to take action.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif, offering a modern, fashionable, avant-garde look suitable for short impactful text.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that combines a modern look and a little warmth, suitable for supplementary information.
- Use a card-based layout with subtle shadows to create a sense of depth and separation between the different sections (bio outputs, settings, etc.).
- Ensure that all UI elements adhere to a consistent grid system to keep the layout structured and well-aligned across different screen sizes.
- Employ a custom set of outlined icons with rounded corners for a modern, friendly appearance. The icons should be related to business, social media, and Nigerian culture.
- Design the main navigation using a bottom navigation bar with clear, easily recognizable icons for key functions (e.g., 'Generate', 'Settings', 'Help'). Ensure the active icon is clearly highlighted.
